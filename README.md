now, lets add something,


lets make the details page detect unreleased movies by comparing the release date against todays date, and show a user friendly toast message that says this movies has not been released yet, check back in 3 days.

and on the details page show a countdown to the release date, keep everything friendly.


this is for movies only, for series we will do it in the episode screen but we wont add a count down.


in both movies and series add a bell icon for notify me and send a notification when the date reaches. for the particualr episode or movie.
